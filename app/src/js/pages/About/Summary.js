    <div className='content'>
      <p>I learn from the community and love to share what I have learned back. I regularly work on everything from Front-end to Full-stack development.</p>
      <p>I believe in choosing the right tool for the job, and maintaining adaptability takes a bit of effort.</p>
      <p>I am constantly practicing my skills in order to grow. I know how technology and business should work together very intuitively, and I never waste time.</p>
      <p>Outside technology, I also love to spend my time with my family and friends or enjoying a cold one.</p>
