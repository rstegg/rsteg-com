      <p>Your best bet is to contact me by email for anything specific: <a href='mailto:stegmannrd@gmail.com'>stegmannrd@gmail.com</a>.</p>
      <p>If you prefer phone, or need a more immediate response, you can send me a text message, but I do not answer calls without appointment: <strong>951 992 2715</strong></p>
      <p>Finally, if you've signed up, you can always comment on here, and let me know what you're thinking!</p>
