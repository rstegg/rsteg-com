      Contact me

      <p>Your best bet is to contact me by email for anything specific: <a href='mailto:stegmannrd@gmail.com'>stegmannrd@gmail.com</a>.</p>
      <p>If you prefer phone, or need a more immediate response, you can send me a text message, but I do not answer calls without appointment: <strong>951 992 2715</strong></p>
      <p>And of course, you can always leave a comment and let me know what you&#39;re thinking!</p>
