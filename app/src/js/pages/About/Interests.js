      <p>I am very interested in declarative, functional programming with a preference against strongly typed languages.
        It is not a popular opinion, but I feel that strong types should be considered at a slightly higher level, where the developer has more control over coercion.
        As far as JavaScript goes, I do not use TypeScript and Flow, but am open to hear your reasoning, and hopefully changing mine!</p>
      <p>Aside from programming, I also love to think about user experience design, and what I can do to make for a better overall experience.</p>
      <p>I&rsquo;m always eager to learn something new.  Contact me if you have any suggestions!</p>
