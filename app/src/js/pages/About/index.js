    General Hobbys: User experience design, content strategy, machine learning

    I learn from the community and love to share what I have learned back. I regularly work on everything from Front-end to Back-end JavaScript.

    I believe in choosing the right tool for the job, and adaptability takes a bit of effort.
    Iâ€™m constantly practicing my skills in order to grow. I know how technology and business should work together very intuitively, and I never waste time.

    Outside technology, I also love to spend my time with my family and friends.
